Repo for GlutenRPG

This project can be made using the make command, or built through Code::Blocks.


If you are running Microsoft Windows, be sure to install PDCurses, then change "#include<ncurses.h>" to point to pdcurses.h (example: #include<curses.h>)
You may also use other curses libraries on any other OS provided it is compatible.

Under UNIX with ncurses , be sure to link -lncurses, on Windows with PDCurses use -lpdcurses instead.

WE HAVE NOT TESTED THIS UNDER MAC OS X OR FREEBSD YET!!!! COMPILE WITH CAUTION!!!
